	<span class="weekly3"> -A1:</span><br />
	 For A1 you will collect data, write Processing code that is a visualization of your data, translate this code into using Illustrator or openJscad, then print and construct a data sculpture from paper. This sculpture will resonate with your data set in some way that makes it meaningful. For instance, if you collected data on your indoor water use, your scuplture might hang in your bathroom. Or if you collected information about the topics of your social media posts, you might make a bullhorn that spews certain words....<br />
	 We will work in-class on developing coding skills for visualization, and engage in feedback meant to further meaningful.<br /><br />
	 
	<ul>
	 <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Weeks 1 -3</span>: Collect and shape data and store in xls, csv, and eventually the Table object in Processing. Using the data set that you have been collecting, you will use the program Processing to import your data, and create a visualization based on your data.</li>	
	 	<li class="in">A1a: <span style="color:#00688B;">Develop a data set you are interested in working with. Maybe you want to track how much compost you create each day, your carbon footprint, or how often you need to water your plants.... Whatever data set you choose to work with, it should be meaningful to you and relate in some way to your daily life. Aim for a minimum of 1-2 weeks of data. For Wednesday bring in what you have collected (ideally 1 week). <br />See description on </span><a href="sept14.html">Sept 14 schedule page</a>.</li>
		<li class="in">A1b: <span style="color:#00688B;">See description on </span><a href="">Oct 05 schedule page</a>.</li>
	 <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Week 4</span>: This visualization will be exported as a PDF file, which you will then bring into Illustrator or openJscad and manipulate your image (if necessary) to create a more	developed/dynamic pattern or image.</li>
	 	<li class="in">A1c: <span style="color:#00688B;">See description on </span><a href="">Oct 12 schedule page</a>.</li>
	 <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Week 4-6</span>: The image you created in Illustrator or openJscad (to be determined what we will use...) will serve as the background design/texture for your data sculpture. This wearable object will be constructed from paper - and then manipulated through folding, cutting, pasting, taping, crumpling, or whatever method you see fit. Your final object will expand and elaborate on the the concepts represented and observed in your initial data.</li>
